Syntax, Folding function and clipboard yank with reformat function for my personal notes

No documentation! It is simple enough as to understand just by looking at the little code. 
 
An example of my notes:

# Install
    ; Bootstrap if doing this not in NetBSD
        Check platform notes <url:http://www.netbsd.org/docs/pkgsrc/platforms.html&gt;
        $ cd pkgsrc/bootstrap
        ; The parameters for OSX -> case and non root user
        $ ./bootstrap --ignore-case-check --unprivileged
